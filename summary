The UDP protocol was utilized to establish communication with the DNS server in order to obtain the IP address associated with the yummyrecipesforme.com domain name. An error message was transmitted via the ICMP protocol to report difficulties in establishing communication with the DNS server. Each log event contains the UDP message that is transmitted from the browser to the DNS server, denoted by the initial two lines. The third and fourth lines of each log entry contain the ICMP error response sent by the DNS server to the browser. This response contains the message "udp port 53 unreachable." Given that port 53 is utilized for DNS protocol traffic to query and request information from DNS servers it is evident that the problem lies with the DNS server. Further indication of DNS protocol execution issues is provided by the plus sign following query identification number 35084, which signifies flags associated with the UDP message, and the "A?" symbol, which signifies flags associated with DNS protocol operations. Port 53 error response indicating an ICMP error suggests that the DNS server is almost certainly not responding. The assertion is additionally substantiated by the indicators that are linked to the domain name retrieval and incoming UDP message.
The occurrence transpired at 1:24 p.m. today. Customers informed the organization that when they attempted to access the website yummyrecipesforme.com, they encountered the error message "destination port unreachable." In order to restore user access to the website, the cybersecurity team that provides IT services to the client organization is presently conducting an investigation into the matter. As part of our inquiry into the matter, we employed tcpdump to perform packet sniffing tests. We determined from the resultant log file that DNS port 53 was unreachable. Subsequently, ascertain whether the firewall is obstructing traffic to port 53 or the DNS server is offline. A successful Denial of Service attack or a configuration error could be the causes of the DNS server's inaccessibility.
